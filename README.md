Multiphysics Simulation of Thermal Runaway Mitigation in Li-ion Battery Packs using COMSOL
Developed a COMSOL Multiphysics model to simulate heat generation and temperature rise in Li-ion cells under varying current loads, integrating electro-thermal coupling.
Implemented phase change material (PCM)-based thermal management in a battery pack to analyze and mitigate thermal runaway propagation, improving safety and performance
